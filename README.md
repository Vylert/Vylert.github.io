🧠 Gemini API Setup (Critical for AI Chat)The VylertAIChat component relies on the Gemini API for its real-time functionality.The API key logic is handled automatically in the execution environment where this code was generated. If you intend to run this application locally outside of that environment, you will need to:Obtain a Gemini API Key.Modify the callGeminiApi function in VylertDashboard.jsx to securely include your key:// In VylertDashboard.jsx:
const callGeminiApi = async (userQuery, systemPrompt, maxRetries = 5) => {
  // Replace the empty string with your actual API key for local use
  const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"; 
  const apiUrl = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025:generateContent?key=${apiKey}`;
  // ... rest of the function
}
💡 How to Use the AI AssistantNavigate to the Vylert AI Assistant panel (the panel with the green border) on the right side of the dashboard.Type a question that requires current, external knowledge (e.g., "What were the key takeaways from the last FOMC meeting?" or "Summarize the current status of the global chip shortage.").Click the Arrow Right button to send the query.The Vylert AI will respond with a concise summary, citing the web sources used for verification at the bottom of the message.
